## So what's this all about?

Energia is a fork/port of Arduino for the TI Launchpad MCU Family.

## What LaunchPad MCUs work right now?

* LaunchPad with MSP430G2231, MSP430G2452 or MSP430G2553
* FraunchPad with MSP430FR5739
* StellarPad with LM4F120H5QR

## I think I need help.

No problem! There are a variety of resources available to get you up and running, and sprinting once you're up and running.

* [GitHub Repo](http://github.com/energia/Energia) - THIS page!
* [Download](http://energia.nu/download/) - Download a compiled application for Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows.
* [Website](http://energia.nu) - Not much here at the moment...
* [Wiki](https://github.com/energia/Energia/wiki) - Find basic information and tutorials here.
* [LaunchPad forum @ 43oh](http://forum.43oh.com/forum/28-energia/) - A community around the original LaunchPad boards (ie: Get help for the original boards here).
* [StellarPad forum @ Stellaristi](http://forum.stellarisiti.com/forum/63-energia/) - Just like the above, except for the newer StellarPad Board.
* [Report bug](http://github.com/energia/Energia/issues) - Is something not working as it ought to? Or better yet, is there something we could make better?
